# Graph Problems

## Introduction
Uses no extra space to modify linked-list

### Pattern:
1. Linked list restructuring: The input data is given as a linked list, and the task is to modify its structure without 
modifying the data of the individual nodes.

2. In-place modification: The modifications to the linked list must be made in place, that is, weâ€™re not allowed to use 
more than O(1) additional space.

### Real World problems:
- **File system management**: for rearranging files within a directory
- **memory management**: for dynamic memory allocation, garbage collection etc
