## Task 1

**Code in [staircase_climb.py](staircase_climb.py)**

### Solution : Simple DFS

````
Time Complexity: O(n) 
Space Complexity: O(1)
````

### Problem Statement

Write a function that does the following task.

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Mention the time and space complexity of your solution.

## Constraints
````
2 <= n <= 45
````
### Example 1

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```
